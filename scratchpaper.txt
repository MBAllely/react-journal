TO DO (ongoing)

11-1-16

Make header into stateless Component

when you click the header, it'll change to 'done' OR change a color OR make some change to state
- make an event fire on a specific event (not to each week) and set in its state

XXX 1. Watch/read study material & take notes
XXX 2. Add missing resources to codebase
XXX 3. Refactor the week display to map instead of hard code the weeks
XXX 4. Add 'add new week' functionality.  It's ok to see how other people did it
5. Maybe refactor so state data is stored in another file?
XXX 6. Refactor style change back to the Week component; add it in the Week component's state.  You'e done it once, you can do it again.
7. Maybe refactor Week Component into Week and AddResource?
8. Get the DOM to rerender when a new week is created
