Make header into stateless Component

when you click the header, it'll change to 'done' OR change a color OR make some change to state
- make an event fire on a specific event (not to each week) and set in its state

1. Watch/read study material & take notes
2. Add missing resources to codebase
3. Refactor the week display to map instead of hard code the weeks
4. Add 'add new week' functionality.  It's ok to see how other people did it
5. Maybe refactor so state data is stored in another file?
6. Refactor style change back to the Week component; add it in the Week component's state.  You'e done it once, you can do it again.


        <Week
          week={ this.state.week1 }
          weekId={ 'week1' }
          addToList={ this.addToList } />

        <Week
          week={ this.state.week2 }
          weekId={ 'week2' }
          addToList={ this.addToList } />

        <Week
          week={ this.state.week3 }
          weekId={ 'week3' }
          addToList={ this.addToList } />

        <Week
          week={ this.state.week4 }
          weekId={ 'week4' }
          addToList={ this.addToList } />

        <Week
          week={ this.state.week5 }
          weekId={ 'week5' }
          addToList={ this.addToList } />
